# python-scada

SCADA (UI Program) which runs via a web-browser. Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, HTML, Database: MySQL, PLC: Siemens S7-1200.<br>
With almost no skills in any of the languages I successfully programmed this Python application and it worked throughout the whole lifetime of the project!
Please keep in mind that I never did a project like this before AND that I did almost everything on my own!

## Background

For my former employer I was working as an Electrical Engineer. One of my responsibilities was programming. It was not programming Java or C++ but programming [programmable logic controllers (PLCs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller). These are basically unbreakable "microcontrollers" used in an industrial environment. The [PLC programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller#Programming) differ a lot from modern high-level programming languages and are somehow out of date.

Programming this UI was enormous fun, I was working 24/7. This project is the main reason why I want to go into developing high-level languages!
